    <h1>Locations</h1>
    <p>
      The Quotient Series spans the globe. You will travel from the mountains of Washington State to the sands of the
      Sahara Desert. The technology and science in the story are real and so are the locations. You can explore the world
      through the eyes of the main character, Kara, and see her journey through real world locations.

      you are there, experiencing the sights, sounds, and smells of these amazing places. Kara and her team travel to the
      following locations:
