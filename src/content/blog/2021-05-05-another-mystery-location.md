This is a beautiful place that I stayed at on vacation recently. It is the location of one of the chapters of 
The Quantum Contingent
. We enjoyed touring the grounds and the walled garden of this castle, as well as the cocktail bar which used to be the O’Brien family library. Any guesses as to where this is?
