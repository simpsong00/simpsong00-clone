Today's blog is another look at one of the locations in the book, 
The Quantum Contingent
. This famous location is quite distinctive, so I don't think there will be any trouble guessing the location.  Chapter 10  of 
The Quantum Contingent
 is set at the University of Oxford in Oxford, England. I already highlighted one picture from Oxford in my second blog post. Today, I wanted to share a few more pictures of places that I describe in the book. Specifically, the Radcliffe Camera, the Bridge of Sighs, St. Helen's Passage and the Turf Tavern. Hopefully the words in my book will bring these pictures in the story to life for you. Enjoy the photos!
