AI-generated art is making a splash. What are the implications to creative professions? I've added two images below, inspired by a scene in my book, 
The Quantum Contingent.
 One was generated using Dall-E 2 from OpenAI and one by the program Midjourney. Both demonstrate the power of AI artwork. Will this eliminate graphic artists from book cover design, illustrators of books, or even threaten human-generated art in general? 

Already, artwork generated by Midjourney won an award at the Colorado State Fair. Not all thought this was fair.

 I think we will see a separate category for AI generated art in a matter of months if not sooner, but that only helps with contests. Will people buy a painting if you can generate one with carefully selected words and a few iterations of an AI program to create your own unique piece of art? Should AI generated Art list the name of the person who generated it as the artist, or should it clearly call out how it was created? Am I the artist of the images below? I don't think so. Do we create a credits screen for the artwork including the people who developed the AI?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this burgeoning field. (Oh, and do you recognize this scene from the book?) 

Oh, and what other fields will AI disrupt?

Image above was generated using mid journey, image below was generated using Dall-E 2.
