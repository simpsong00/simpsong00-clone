Some people have been surprised to hear that I have “beta” readers. Beta readers are not unlike software beta testers, They are early adopters who try your software/manuscript out and give you feedback on how they liked it. (They also point out errors!) I have about 25 beta readers and I’ve enjoyed getting their feedback. In fact, as a result of the feedback, in addition to many updates, I’ve added one more chapter! (and yes that means one more song on the playlist) Here’s a picture from where this chapter is based. 
Can you guess what country or the specific location this photo was taken?

Oh, and 
The Quantum Contingent 
 playlist is now updated on Spotify at: 
[https://spoti.fi/3CBPE06](https://spoti.fi/3CBPE06)
. I actually used one of the songs that was already in the playlist for the new chapter. (because the title of the song appeared in the new chapter!) So, used a new song for the old chapter I stole the song from! The new song’s title has also been incorporated into the old chapter. The new song is 
Adventure of a Lifetime
, by Coldplay. 
Can you guess what song that was already on the playlist is now associated with the new chapter?

Talk soon!
