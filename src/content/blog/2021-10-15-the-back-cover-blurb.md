I found one of the more  difficult things to write for the book is the back cover blurb. I thought I'd share the draft text of the back cover here. Let me know your thoughts. Does it catch your attention in the first sentence? Does it make you want to read the book? I'd love your feedback.

Oh, and I now have an ISBN number... one step closer.

Till next time, Greg

In 2028, a mysterious group known as The Quantum

Contingent has achieved true quantum computing

capabilities. The Quantum Contingent have their sights 

set on achieving immortality for a select few that will 

chart humanity’s destiny. 

Jack and Sarah, sibling spies, race across the globe at

a frenetic pace to stop this nefarious group and their

anonymous Founder. Jack and Sarah are part of Quotient,

​a mysterious, independent, spy agency whose secret 

advantage is also quantum based. 

The Quantum Contingent takes place in exotic destinations 

around the globe and features real technologies, extrapolated 

for tomorrow, including cryptocurrency, drones, and SpaceX 

rocket ships. It is a techno-spy thriller for today with pop-culture 

references and even its own Spotify playlist, featuring a song

 for each chapter in the book.

 Greg spent his career in technology.

He did a TedX talk on AI and has

channeled his technology and global

travel experiences into The Quantum

Contingent. The cover is based on

the church of St. George, one of the

monolithic ‘rock churches’ in Lalibela,

Ethiopia. Greg is shown here outside

of this World Heritage site, which

serves as a key location in the novel.
