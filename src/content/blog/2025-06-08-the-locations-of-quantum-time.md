One of the trademarks of my novels are real world locations, most of which I have been to before. For the next few weeks I'll be highlighting some interesting sites from Quantum Time. This week, I'd like to start with something more personal instead of exotic. In Quantum Time, we visit Cincinnati. Cincinnati has been my home for the last 24 years! We're going to look at two key places in Cincinnati, the Cincinnati Museum Center, and Skyline Chili! Both have a feature in the book.

IThe Cincinnati Museum Center is an extravagant art déco passenger train station built between 1929 and 1933 and has carvings of the Greek God Mercury on each side of its immense arched facade. It was the inspiration of the Hall of Justice in the DC comic universe! In addition, its dramatic ceiling over the rotunda lobby is awe-inspiring. 
The gold and orange rings above the Winold Reiss glass tile mosaics are stunning. 
The half dome entrance is one hundred and six feet tall and one hundred and eighty feet wide, 
the second largest in the world
, behind only the Sydney Opera House. Pictures of both the exterior and interior are included below.

The second location I'm highlighting this week is Skyline Chili! Skyline is a staple in Cincinnati. Known as "Cincinnati Chili" it is a unique dish, 
The “three-way” is a well-loved, unusual concoction of spaghetti noodles with a layer of secretly spiced chili, topped by a mountainous pile of finely shredded cheddar cheese. 4 and 5 way editions are available with the addition of onions or beans or both. The cheese coney is another classic, 
featuring a mini hotdog with their secret chili sauce and more of that finely cheddar cheese. Mustard and onions are optional. No pictures of Skyline, you'll just need to experience it for yourself. 

​Next time we'll look at Oxford University, the location of Cassie's lab, the Continuum.
