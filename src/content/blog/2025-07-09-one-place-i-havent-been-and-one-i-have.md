One place I haven't been that Jack and Sarah went to in 
Quantum Time
 is northern Sweden.

In the mountains of Sarek National Park in Sweden, icy cliffs soar over the horizon like something out of the animated film character Elsa’s nightmares. Sarek is the oldest national park in Europe. It was established in 1909 and is known for having six of Sweden’s peaks over two thousand meters. A climber’s paradise. Just outside the park is Áhkká. This massif includes twelve individual peaks and ten glaciers. The highest peak features a vertical drop of almost a mile to a lake in the valley below.  

My inspiration for this location was actually 
Jungfraujoch in Switzerland. It is a stunning view, near where more than one James Bond scene was filmed. See my photo below. Although I never made it to Sarek National Park, I did make it to Jungfraujock, and I did visit a Chocolate Factory in Oslo, Sweden,  another key location in Quantum Time.
