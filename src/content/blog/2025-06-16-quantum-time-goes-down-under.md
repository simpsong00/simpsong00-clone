One of the more interesting places 
Quantum Time
 takes you is down under! From Botany Bay to the Sydney Harbour Bridge to Uluru, the adventure traverses the continent.

Uluru, or Ayers Rock, is an anomaly. After you fly across the arid red center of the Northern Territory, there it is. The giant sandstone monolith looks like it fell from space and landed in the middle of the desert. It is twenty-four meters taller than the Eiffel Tower and goes at least two and a half kilometers underground. Some say it might extend as deep as six kilometers. Its brilliant red hues, caused by a high amount of surface iron oxidation, are amplified by the setting sun. Tourists stand in the desert with netting hanging down from their hats to protect their faces from the biting desert flies. They drink a champagne toast as the sunset splashes across the rock and reflects the rays with a red grandeur. 

Back at the coast, the Bondi lifeguards watch over the swimmers. The beach makes a graceful arch and is home to the the famous Bondi Iceberg saltwater pool, where the crashing waves created a melody capable of soothing even the most frenzied of nerves.

The Harbour Bridge in Sydney provides a perfect vantage point to view the stunning Sydney Opera House. I've attached some of my personal photos of the locations!

Join the adventure and read Quantum Time!
