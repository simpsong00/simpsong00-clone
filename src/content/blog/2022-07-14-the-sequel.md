First, thank you to all of you who have read 
The Quantum Contingent
. I hope you enjoyed the book. I know I enjoyed the journey of creating it. I had lots of help. One of the common questions I get is, ‘Are you going to write another book?’ And the answer is yes! I do want to write a sequel. I’ve finally learned a little about how this entire process works, so I may as well take my learnings and try again. It should be easier the second time, right? The next book will be a sequel. It will be more complicated than 
The Quantum Contingent 
because it will take place in two time periods. (I don't want it to be too easy) First, it will take place shortly following the end of 
The Quantum Contingent
 in 2029. In addition, it will have an entangled timeline from 2049… twenty years later. This will allow me to stretch some technology limits to almost sci-fi levels. I’ll still try to achieve a sense of realism, but as a result will explore technologies much more advanced than those in 
The Quantum Contingent
. For example, I’ll take the metaverse beyond the simple virtual reality conference rooms of 2028. My question for you, is what technologies do you want to see? Are there locations around the globe you’d like me to cover? I’ve started the book. (but don’t have that one year retirement anniversary deadline hanging over me this time) I’ve got some fundamental plot points laid out and have some good locations that I didn’t include in the first book. I even have close to 5000 words written. So, I think it will be a reality. I just don't know when.

The photo below is from one of the new locations in the sequel. Does anyone know where it is from?

​

Anyway, if you have any thoughts, I’m all ears. Thanks for listening.

​Greg
