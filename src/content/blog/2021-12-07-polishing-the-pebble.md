Sometimes I feel like a small babbling brook, just polishing the same pebble, over and over... Editing my stream of consciousness to make the pebble smoother and more pleasant to the touch. In this case, the pebble is 
The Quantum Contingent
. Recently, I've done some heavier polishing. Thanks to some fabulous input from my editor, Bridget, I cut one chapter, consolidated a couple of others, rearranged a few more, and can now see a path to a finished product. I'm reading it again and doing some more final 'fine' polishing. For example, did you know you capitalize names of wines named after regions, but not those names after grapes? Hence it's Chianti with a capital C and merlot with a lowercase m. Yes, I'm trying to make sure I get these details correct too!  

I also updated a song on the playlist. (based on an edit I did to the chapter) Therefore, Tears for Fears, 
Everybody Wants to Rule the World
 has been replaced by 
Castle on the Hill
 by Ed Sheeran. (and yes, the title of the song appears in the chapter) I like Ed's music a lot, so it was a pleasant change for me. Apologies to the Tears for Fears fans. Of course, the aforementioned chapter cut and consolidation resulted in the loss of a couple of other songs on the playlist. The book is now a nice round 50 chapters. 

​I've also been refining the photos that will head each chapter and refining the interior formatting with Vellum.

The Quantum Contingent
 will be out in early 2022, initially in paperback and ebook format, with an audiobook to follow. The voice talent is lined up. I just need to finish polishing this pebble. I'm seeing another pebble in this brook I'd like to work on.... but I need to finish this one first.

Happy December. Till next time!
