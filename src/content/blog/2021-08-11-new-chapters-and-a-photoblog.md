I did a lot of editing this past week in preparation for the beta reader release. In fact, I added two chapters. One was entirely new, the other was more of a split of an earlier chapter into two chapters. You know what it means when I add chapters? More songs on 
The Quantum Contingent
 playlist. Check it out on Spotify here:

If you are thinking about writing a book, one thing to be aware of is that every time you edit the book for content, you introduce the possibility of basic line/copy edit errors, poor style choices, and even continuity issues. So, when I edit for content, I usually end up doing a copy edit for grammar, a “read through” edit and an automated style edit after the fact to make sure I flushed out minor errors, didn’t introduce something that wasn’t consistent with the rest of the book, and actually added value to the book. (I’m not as rigorous on my blog posts, sorry!)

This is one reason it is helpful to keep your book divided up into chapters or even scenes so you can do these recursive edits on smaller portions of your document at a time. I also played with a new tool this week called Sudowrite. Sudowrite is an AI writers' companion that helps provide descriptive prose and will even try to write the next paragraph of your novel based on the past paragraph using their “wormhole” command. It is one of the most advanced attempts at this type of tool that I’ve seen. I can see where some of the descriptive tools could be useful. Instead of just telling you to include descriptive words involving taste in a scene, it provides fully fleshed out examples specific to your writing. I don’t plan to add any additional AI generated content to my book at this point, but it will be interesting to see how this technology evolves. So far, humans are still winning this race, but the robots are getting smarter. (I did include one line of AI generated content as I mentioned in an earlier blog.)

Now for a few fun photos from places in 
The Quantum Contingent
… here are pictures of Cleveland, Captiva Island, Florida, Dorado Beach, Puerto Rico, Amsterdam, London, and Ireland. All are locations in 
The Quantum Contingent
. The beta copy is releasing now!

Have a great week!
