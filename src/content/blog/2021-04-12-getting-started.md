Thank you for following along on my journey. As the old Chinese proverb says, "The journey is the reward." (also the title of a Steve Jobs biography)

I'll be posting weekly updates on the progress of my first novel, 
The Quantum Contingent,
 to this blog. Topics will range from resources to help you learn how to write a novel, to personal pictures and stories of locations in the book. (The website cover photo, on the River Reuss in Switzerland, the blog cover photo, Ngorongoro Crater and the 'About the Author' photo are all personal pictures I've taken and are all scenes in the book.) In addition, I'll include discussions on some of the many technologies in the book. (you can see a sampling of the technologies on the technology page) 

Please join me on the journey and comment below on any other topics you'd like me to include in my weekly blogs. With that intro, here is my first blog entry... it's all about getting started.

The first thing you have to do in any major undertaking is to start. In addition, if you are like me and a first-time author, you have to open yourself up to learning. The good news is that there are many good online options for learning. I started with a Coursera class on Creative Writing, learning many basics in fiction like "show don't tell" and many other approaches from the people at Wesleyan University. Now, I've begun a 'Masterclass' by Dan Brown on writing a thriller. The Masterclass formula is designed for the modern learner; 10 minute video segments, available via a smart phone or Apple TV app, a well written workbook, and the ability to switch to a listen-only podcast mode.

So, if you are interested in taking up any hobby, remember, there are lessons everywhere to help you progress. I've been to many websites, and have leveraged several books, including, 
On Writing, 
A Memoir of the Craft
, by Stephen King.
 G
ifted to me by my friends at Synchrony on my retirement.

Certainly, as far as writing goes, the best advice is to 
read
. It is impossible to be a writer if you aren't a reader. It humbles me every time I pick up a good book and read it through my new lens of 'writing,' realizing the amazing world talented authors create.

So, I hope you'll follow along on this journey. As I said, it will be a variety, (fun personal photos and deep technical treats) so pick the parts you enjoy and read along. I'd love to hear from you in the comments below. Questions or simple motivations are welcome!

Enjoy,

Greg
