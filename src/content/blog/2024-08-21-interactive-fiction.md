If you are old enough to remember Zork, or the original Adventure, then I have a treat for you! I am launching

Quotient, the Game!

It's a tongue-in-cheek 
interactive fiction
  adventure featuring the characters of The Quantum Contingent and Quantum Time. You wander around the world by typing commands like "north"... and solve puzzles and collect treasures along the way. You earn points and ranks based on how many points you have. You can give it a try right now, just click the button to open the game in another window.
