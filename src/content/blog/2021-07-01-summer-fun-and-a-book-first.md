It’s summertime and for many that means fun outside with friends and family. If you know me, you know I love to dance, and that means I like listening to good music. When writing my book, I used several pop culture references along the way, and that made me think of some of my favorite songs.

Last week, I said I had one more surprise up my sleeve, and here it is: 
The Quantum Contingent
 has a 
[playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1235670332/playlist/1OgAjV587jSyJNvHjZYcso?si=PXKE_BDSTuKdbQzKTQuI4A)
. The handcrafted Spotify 
[playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1235670332/playlist/1OgAjV587jSyJNvHjZYcso?si=PXKE_BDSTuKdbQzKTQuI4A)
 has one song for each chapter. Each song connects to the chapter of the book in a unique way. Some connect in obvious ways, others in more subtle ways and others in more elaborate, detailed ways. In at least ten of the chapters, the title of the song appears in the chapter. Of course, it’s pretty easy to get a one-word song title in a chapter (like 
Birthday
, by Katy Perry or 
Africa
 by Toto). Also, based on the number of Taylor Swift songs I included in the 
[playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1235670332/playlist/1OgAjV587jSyJNvHjZYcso?si=PXKE_BDSTuKdbQzKTQuI4A)
, you'll be able to infer I'm a fan.

So, I encourage you to head on over to Spotify and listen to 
The Quantum Contingent

[playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1235670332/playlist/1OgAjV587jSyJNvHjZYcso?si=PXKE_BDSTuKdbQzKTQuI4A)
. Don’t be afraid to break out a few of your favorite dance moves. The songs on the playlist are in the order of the chapters in the book, but I won’t share the chapter titles yet, just the

.

I suspect after you read the book, you might have some questions about some of the songs and how they relate... that will have to wait until after the book is out! In the meantime, I just thought I'd share the playlist so you could use it when you are out enjoying yourself this summer!

The blue links above take you to spotify. If you just want to see the list of songs, you can see it here:

(of course the entire list is subject to change!)

Happy listening,

Greg
