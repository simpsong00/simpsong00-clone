I'm really enjoying the narration of my game by @jwalrus over on intfiction.org. Here are the photos that he's uncovered so far. I'll add more photos to this post as they come up in the "Let's Play" adventure.

If you'd like to follow along as @jwalrus plays, here's a link:

Enjoy the photos, and check back for more as they come up in the game.
