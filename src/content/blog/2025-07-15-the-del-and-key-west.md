Two U.S. locations featured in Quantum Time are The Hotel Del Coronado (The Del) and Key West. 
The legendary Del has been a resort enjoyed by celebrities and the powerful, as well as beach-loving tourists, since it was built in 1888. It is one of the largest wooden buildings in the US and its white wooden structure shows off its classic, timeless design. It is located on Coronado Island, across San Diego Bay from downtown San Diego.

Key West, only ninety miles from Cuba, was known for its laid-back island vibe with Jimmy Buffett music, Ernest Hemingway ramblings, and beautiful sunsets. Tourists come from around the world to sample the Caribbean cuisine and enjoy the easygoing island vibes of the Conch Republic. 
However, it wasn’t only an island paradise. The US Navy put a base has at the same time Key West was settled in the 1820s. In 1917, the Key West Naval Air Station was born.  If you read Quantum Time, you'll hear a little about what Key West is like in 2049.

Of course, then there are the roosters... 

Enjoy!
