I've crossed a key milestone in writing my book, the rough draft manuscript. I'll call it the "alpha" release. I've sent the alpha release to an impartial developmental editor. I've had some wonderful developmental editing from my daughter and wife, but this will be from an impartial third party. After I incorporate her feedback, I'll be at the "beta" stage. (I get the feedback on 7/31) If you'd like to be a "beta" reader, you'd need to be willing to not only read the book, but provide constructive feedback on the book. What did you like, what didn't you like? Was there something you didn't understand? Was a section that was boring? Was there a section that was great? I plan to send beta copies out to volunteers in September. If you are interested, use the form to provide your email and preferred format. I will also ask beta readers to submit a review on Amazon when the time comes!

Now I need to learn about amazon keyword advertising and recruit my creative son to do a book cover design for me. After that, I'll get those final beta reader tweaks in place, do a final proof edit and submit for publishing. Learning how to do a good launch will probably be the most difficult part of the process. Print, e-book, local book stores, Amazon, Barnes and Noble... there are several nuances to work through to make this a good launch. 

I do have one more surprise up my sleeve. Come back next week to learn about one unique aspect of my book.

In the meantime, I'll leave you with an excerpt from my book and the pictures that inspired it. You'll recognize one picture from the cover of my website.

Until next time,

Greg

Looking upriver, he could see the famous Lucerne-Chapel bridge in the distance. He hastened down the intricate wrought-iron railing to the fifth table and waited for his contact. The river water reflected the bright noon sunlight. He dropped a pebble in the water and could see it drift slowly all the way to the bottom of the clean, mountain fed river. 

The church across the river had green patina on its copper covered steeples. It reminded him of the many greenbacks he hoped to earn for his loyalty to the ‘Contingent’.
