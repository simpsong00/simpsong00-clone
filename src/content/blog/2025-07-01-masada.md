In Quantum Time, Jack and Sarah also end up in Israel, both in Jerusalem and at Masada. Masada is an imposing site, a rocky plateau, with thirteen-hundred-foot cliffs to the East, and three-hundred-foot cliffs to the West. It made an outstanding fortification for a palace. The ruins of King Herod’s palaces stretch across three different terraces of the sprawling plateau. A hundred years after King Herod built his palaces here, a group of Jews took refuge from the Romans at the top of Masada. Here are some of my pictures to help set the scene for the chapter called, The Promise.

Enjoy!
